# AirBnB_clone_v2
## Data base preparations

    - A database hbnb_dev_db
    - A new user hbnb_dev (in localhost)
    - The password of hbnb_dev should be set to hbnb_dev_pwd
    - hbnb_dev should have all privileges on the database hbnb_dev_db (and only this database)
    - hbnb_dev should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
    - If the database hbnb_dev_db or the user hbnb_dev already exists, your script should not fail
